Launch an Amazon Linux Machine
yum update -y 
yum install python
yum install pip -y
pip install ansible
ansible --version ( You will be seeing config file as none )
cd /etc/
mkdir ansible
cd ansible
mkdir roles and touch ansible.cfg and touch hosts
Check ansible --version ( Now you will get the default directory structure )
Create user ansadmin and give password
useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin
Give root priveleges to ansadmin by going to visudo
Need to change password authentication as YES by going into vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart sshd
Switch to the user ansadmin by sudo su ansadmin
You need to create same useransadmin and follow the same procedure as mentioned above (From step12 - step18)
Generate key by using ssh-keygen
cd /home/ansadmin/.ssh
Go to .ssh/ and you will find private key(id_rsa) and public key (id_rsa_pub)  
Now we need to connect to other node by using this key by using command ssh-copy-id <ip address>
Go vi hosts and add the node ip address over there,save it 
Hit ansible all -m ping -i hosts
